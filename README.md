## Cognifyz-ML-Tasks
This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the Cognifyz ML Internship. Tasks involve restaurant rating prediction, cuisine classification, and location analysis using Python, scikit-learn, and NLP techniques. The project focuses on enhancing recommendation systems through data-driven insights.

__Selected Tasks__
  - This internship allows participants to work on any 3 out of 4 tasks:
    -  Predict Restaurant Ratings – Build a predictive model to estimate restaurant ratings based on customer feedback and features.
    - Restaurant Recommendation System – Develop a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering or content-based approaches.
    - Cuisine Classification – Classify cuisines using NLP techniques applied to restaurant descriptions.
    - Location Analysis – Analyze geographical data and trends affecting restaurant performance.

- Technologies Used
  - Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)
  - Machine Learning (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
  - Natural Language Processing (NLTK, regex)
  - Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
