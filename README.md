## Cognifyz-ML-Tasks
This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the Cognifyz ML Internship. Tasks involve restaurant rating prediction, cuisine classification, and location analysis using Python, scikit-learn, and NLP techniques. The project focuses on enhancing recommendation systems through data-driven insights.

- __Selected Tasks__
  - This internship allows participants to work on any 3 out of 4 tasks:
    -  Predict Restaurant Ratings – Built a regression model to estimate restaurant ratings using user feedback, pricing, and delivery options.
    - Restaurant Recommendation System – Developed a content-based engine using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for smart restaurant suggestions
    - Cuisine Classification – Applied multi-label classification techniques to predict cuisine types using restaurant metadata and frequency analysis.
    - Location Analysis – was not selected.
      
- __Technologies Used__
  - Python - Core programming language
  - Libraries & Tools:
    - pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
    - matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
    - scikit-learn – Machine learning and evaluation
  - Modeling Techniques:
    - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor
    - Content-based filtering with TF-IDF + cosine similarity
    - Multi-label classification with MultiOutputClassifier 
  - Feature Engineering:
    - Label binarization, MinMax scaling, importance analysis
