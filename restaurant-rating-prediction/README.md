### Restaurant Rating Prediction
- This project aims to predict restaurant ratings using machine learning techniques based on features such as Votes, cuisine, Average cost for two, delivery options, and more. It showcases end-to-end model development with a focus on interpretability, feature engineering, and stakeholder-ready outputs.

- __Project Highlights__
        - Cleaned and encoded diverse features including cuisine types, city frequencies, and service flags.
        - Performed detailed EDA and feature scaling to prep data for modeling.
        - Trained and compared models (Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor).
        - Visualized feature importance and evaluated model performance using R² and RMSE.
        - Built clear visual and textual summaries for professional presentation.

- __Key Outcomes__
        - Improved Predictive Accuracy: Achieved reliable restaurant rating predictions using Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.
        - Feature Impact Uncovered: Identified top predictors of rating—such as Votes, City_freq, and service availability—through model interpretation.
        - Scalable Modeling Pipeline: Designed a reusable and modular ML workflow from preprocessing to model evaluation.
        - Stakeholder-Ready Insights: Delivered interpretable results with visualizations and concise summaries for business decision-making.

- __Technology Used__
        - Language: Python
        - Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
        - Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor
        - Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
