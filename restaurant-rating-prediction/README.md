Restaurant Rating Prediction
This project aims to predict restaurant ratings using machine learning techniques based on features such as location, cuisine, cost, delivery options, and more. It showcases end-to-end model development with a focus on interpretability, feature engineering, and stakeholder-ready outputs.

Project Highlights
Cleaned and encoded diverse features including cuisine types, city frequencies, and service flags.

Performed detailed EDA and feature scaling to prep data for modeling.

Trained and compared models (Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor).

Visualized feature importance and evaluated model performance using R² and RMSE.

Built clear visual and textual summaries for professional presentation.

Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor
